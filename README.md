## Welcome

You will be hard-pressed to find a field of research or application that cannot benefit from programming. The science and practice of river restoration is no exception. 

I have set the goal of earning a Master's in Hydrologic Science for myself. In addition to that goal, I have also challenged myself to learn and utilize whatever programming skills I can during my studies. Programming not only allows tedious tasks to be automated, but encourages more creative problem solving and provides more robust options for data analysis and management. This is why I have chosen to share the scripts I develop on GitHub with hope that they can be utilized by others that may find them useful.
